# Small Programs in TypeScript, PHP, and Python

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small, self-contained programs written in **TypeScript**, **PHP**, and **Python**. Each program demonstrates solutions to simple problems, algorithm implementations, and concepts in programming. The goal is to explore language-specific features, programming patterns and techniques, and deepen my knowledge and understanding on these programming languages.
